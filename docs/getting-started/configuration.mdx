# Configuration

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

:::note
Kohl's Admin is currently in development. Everything in these docs is subject to change.
:::

This shows you how to configure Kohl's Admin to your liking, and how to continue setting it up.

This will show you the location between the 2 settings scripts for both the New and Legacy Loaders.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="pros" label="KA New Loader" default>
		Kohl's Admin > Config > Settings
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="cons" label="KA Legacy Loader">
		Kohl's Admin > Config > Legacy > Settings
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have KA installed in your game before continuing.

- **KA Installation Guide**: Click [here](/docs/getting-started/installation) to go to the setup guide.

Also ensure that you have both the **Explorer** and **Properties** tabs open.

- You can do this by going to **View** on the menu of Roblox Studio, and toggle `Explorer` and `Properties` which is on the top left.

:::warning
There are 2 `Settings` scripts, one under `Config > Settings` and the other in `Config > Legacy > Settings`, these are **DIFFERENT** and depend on the if you are using the `Legacy` version or not.

## Hierarchy of Admin Powers

### New Loader:

The new loader does not stack admin perks, they are now separated by default.

```lua
0	everyone
1	vip
2	mod
3	admin
4	superadmin
inf	creator
```

### Legacy Loader:

```lua
0			Player
1			VIP					Can use nonabusive commands only on self
2			Moderator			Can kick, mute, & use most commands
3			Administrator		Can ban, crash, & set Moderators/VIP
4			SuperAdmin			Can grant permanent powers, & shutdown the game
5			Owner				Can set SuperAdmins, & use all the commands
6			Game Creator		Can set owners & use all the commands
```

## Configuring the New Loader

### Banning players from your game

Stores bans in format: `["UserId"] = {Username, Reason, Duration, BannedByUserId}`

Duration values:

- -1: Permanent ban
- 0: Server ban
- > 0: Temporary ban (UTC timestamp in seconds for ban expiry)

```lua
bans = {
	["2"] = { "John Doe", "He been noob.", nil, 44391621 },
	["3"] = { "Jane Doe", "She was noob.", 1720922623, 44391621 },
	["5"] = { nil, "Deleted account", -1, 44391621 },
},
```

Defines the hierarchy, permissions, and capabilities of each role, you can create as many custom roles as you want!

```lua
	roles = {
		{ -- Default Role
			_key = "everyone", -- ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT CHANGE

			name = "Player",
			color = "#aaa", -- Hex color only

			groups = {
				-- "creator", --        clearlogs, hidelogs, script, localscript, etc.

			color = "#0ff",
			groups = { "vip" },
			limits = { cooldown = 4, commands = 16, targets = 1 },
			permissions = {},
			onlyTargetSelf = true,
		},

		-- üé≠ Create as many roles as you want!
		-- Use the _key in other settings like friendRoles to auto give the role
		-- Helper would be higher rank than VIP, and lower than moderator

		-- {
		-- 	_key = "helper",
		-- 	name = "Helper",
		-- 	color = "#080",

## Configuring the Legacy Loader

### Banning Someone from Joining

Unedited Script:

```lua
local Banned = { "someoneyoudislike" } -- For those who have wronged you, & this guy
```

You can add more people or a single player by adding their Username or UserID. The list is endless.

```lua
local Banned = { "someoneyoudislike", "Roblox", 1234567 } -- For those who have wronged you, & this guy
```

### Adding Someone to your Admin List

Unedited Script:

```lua
local Owners = {} -- Can set SuperAdmins, & use all the commands
local SuperAdmins = {} -- Can set permanent admins, & shutdown the game
local Admins = {} -- Can ban, crash, & set Moderators/VIP
local Mods = {} -- Can kick, mute, & use most commands
local VIP = {} -- Can use nonabusive commands only on self
```

You can add more people or a single player by adding their Username or UserID. The list is endless.

```lua
local Owners = {"someoneyoudislike", "Roblox", 1234567} -- Can set SuperAdmins, & use all the commands
...
```

### Settings

This part should be pretty self explantory. The things they do are noted next to them.

```lua
-- Style Options
Flat = true, -- Enables Flat theme / Disables Aero theme
ForcedColor = false, -- Forces everyone to have set color & transparency
Color = Color3.new(0, 0, 0), -- Changes the Color of the user interface
ColorTransparency = 0.75, -- Changes the Transparency of the user interface
Chat = false, -- Enables the custom chat
BubbleChat = false, -- Enables the custom bubble chat

-- Basic Settings
AdminCredit = true, -- Enables the credit GUI for that appears in the bottom right
AutoClean = false, -- Enables automatic cleaning of hats & tools in the Workspace
AutoCleanDelay = 60, -- The delay between each AutoClean routine
CommandBar = true, -- Enables the Command Bar | GLOBAL KEYBIND: \
FunCommands = true, -- Enables fun yet unnecessary commands
FreeAdmin = false, -- Set to 1-5 to grant admin powers to all, otherwise set to false
JoinMessage = true, -- Shows an admin message on join with the prefix and your current rank
PublicLogs = false, -- Allows all users to see the command & chat logs
Prefix = ";", -- Character to begin a command
```

### Adding a Group to your Admin List

This part should also be pretty self explantory as well, the required information is stated below the spot where you are supposed to fill them.

```lua
GroupAdmin = {
	[12345] = { [254] = 4, [253] = 3 };
	[GROUP_ID] = { [RANK] = ADMIN_POWER };
}
```

To add on more groups or ranks, just add on this line under.

```lua
[12345] = { [254] = 4, [253] = 3 };
```

### Adding VIP Perks to your Game

This part should also be self explantory, the required information is stated under.

```lua
VIPAdmin = {
	[-12345] = 3; -- negative item_id (-12345) indicates a GamePass
	[12345] = 3; -- positive is every other catalog asset (shirts, pants, hats, etc)
	[54321] = 4;
	[ITEM_ID] = ADMIN_POWER;
}
```

To add on more assets for VIP, just add a line under.

```lua
[54321] = 4;
```

### Command Limits

This should be self explantory too, the required information is stated above.

```lua
-- COMMAND_LIMIT    - How many commands can be used at once to prevent abuse.
-- COOLDOWN_SECONDS - How long to wait between commands to prevent abuse.
-- [ADMIN_POWER]= { COMMAND_LIMIT, COOLDOWN_SECONDS }
CommandLimits = {
	[0] = { 1, 10 }, -- Player (rank 0) can use 1 command every 10 seconds
	[1] = { 16, 5 }, -- VIP (rank 1) can use 10 commands every 5 seconds
	[2] = { 32, 1 }, -- Moderator (rank 2) can use 16 commands every 1 second
	[3] = { 64, 1 }, -- Administrator (rank 3) can use 32 commands every 1 second
	[4] = { 128, 1 }, -- SuperAdmin (rank 4) can use 64 commands every 1 second
	[5] = { math.huge, 0 }, -- Owner (rank 5) can use infinite commands every 0 seconds
	[6] = { math.huge, 0 }, -- Game Creator (rank 6) can use infinite commands every 0 seconds
	[7] = { math.huge, 0 }, -- True Game Creator (rank 7) can use infinite commands every 0 seconds
},
```

### Command Permissions

You can refer to the admin permissions table to set up permissions, commands can be found by using the `:cmds` command in chat, or `cmd` in the commandbar.

```lua
Permissions = {
	-- fly = 0; -- uncomment this line to allow everyone to fly!
},
```

## Verify Installation

1. Open and play the experience that you've imported the model into.
2. Test some basic commands to make sure the admin commands are functioning as expected.
